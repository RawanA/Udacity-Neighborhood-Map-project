## Chalenges 
### 1. Filtering the Locations accourding to the searching word.
Creating a function with 
```
substring
```
### 2. Only Clikced on Location animates and changes in color.
creating a function that has a for loop and sets all locations to default sitting, then alters the clicked location's.

## Notes
###  no @media feature implemented in the css file.
Only a button that dislpays a *div* of locations , is with the map, therefore there was no need for that feature.
